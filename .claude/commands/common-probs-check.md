# Common problem workflow
## Goal
Ensure that any previous problems which were flagged and a solution was given are remembered here, so that if the problem re-arises, due to reverted to a previous commit or Claude Code makes a previous mistake again, we can re-implement the fix.

## Steps

## \#1 \ Check if through each of the problems in the "Common Problems" section below sequentially to see if they are present anywhere in the code.

## Common Problems

## \#1 \ When playing in human vs computer mode, the computer doesn't move. This happens because the computer's color isn't set properly. Set the color and the problem goes away.
