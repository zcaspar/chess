# Chess App Deployment - Next Steps

## Current Status âœ…

### Completed:
1. âœ… Fixed chess timeout bug - game now properly ends when time runs out
2. âœ… Implemented complete multiplayer system with Socket.io
3. âœ… Created Firebase project and generated admin credentials
4. âœ… Successfully deployed backend to Railway at: https://eloquent-solace-production.up.railway.app (or similar)
5. âœ… Backend health check returning OK
6. âœ… PostgreSQL database connected and initialized

### Repository Structure:
- Main repo at `/home/caspar/Documents/Coding/Chess/chess-app`
- Backend code merged into main repository (no longer separate)
- Client firebase config moved to `client-files/` directory to avoid build issues

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

### 1. Deploy Frontend to Vercel
The user needs to:
1. Go to https://vercel.com and login with GitHub
2. Import the chess repository
3. Configure with these settings:
   - Framework: Vite
   - Root Directory: `./` (leave empty)
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
4. Add environment variables (see below)

### 2. Environment Variables for Vercel
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://[railway-backend-url].railway.app
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://[railway-backend-url].railway.app
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=[from Firebase console]
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=[project-id].firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=[project-id]
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=[project-id].appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=[sender-id]
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=[app-id]
```

### 3. Update Backend CORS Settings
Once frontend is deployed to Vercel:
1. Go to Railway backend service â†’ Variables
2. Update these variables:
   ```
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://[your-app].vercel.app
   FRONTEND_URL=https://[your-app].vercel.app
   ```
3. Railway will auto-redeploy

### 4. Initialize Database Tables
If not already done, run the SQL from `database/init.sql` in the PostgreSQL database.

### 5. Test Complete System
1. Visit the Vercel frontend URL
2. Create an account or sign in with Google
3. Create a game room and get the 6-character code
4. Share with a friend to test multiplayer
5. Verify moves sync in real-time

## Known Issues & Fixes

### Firebase Client File
- Moved to `client-files/firebase.client.ts` to prevent backend build errors
- Frontend needs this moved back to proper location before frontend deployment

### Database Connection
- Backend expects `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Railway PostgreSQL provides this automatically when services are linked

### Build Warnings
- "punycode module deprecated" - can be ignored, it's from a dependency
- "Lc0 engines not available" - expected in production, AI features limited

## File Locations
- Backend entry: `src/server.ts`
- Socket handler: `src/sockets/gameSocket.ts`
- Database config: `src/config/database.ts`
- Firebase admin: `src/config/firebase.ts`
- Frontend entry: `src/main.tsx`
- Game context: `src/contexts/GameContext.tsx`
- Socket context: `src/contexts/SocketContext.tsx`

## Commands for Testing
```bash
# Test backend health
curl https://[railway-url].railway.app/health

# Run frontend locally (after setting .env)
npm run dev

# Check Railway logs
railway logs
```

## Final Checklist
- [ ] Frontend deployed to Vercel
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel
- [ ] CORS updated in Railway backend
- [ ] Database tables initialized
- [ ] Multiplayer tested end-to-end
- [ ] Share game links with friends!

## Notes for Next Session
- User has Railway Hobby plan active
- Multiple Railway services were created during debugging - only PostgreSQL and backend needed
- Repository is public on GitHub
- Firebase project exists and admin credentials are in Railway variables
