# Chess App - Next Steps & Action Items

## üéØ Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
1. ‚úÖ Full chess game with all rules implemented
2. ‚úÖ Real-time multiplayer with Socket.io
3. ‚úÖ Firebase authentication (Google + Guest accounts)
4. ‚úÖ Backend deployed to Railway
5. ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database connected
6. ‚úÖ Fixed chess timer timeout bug
7. ‚úÖ AI opponent with Stockfish integration
8. ‚úÖ Comprehensive project documentation

### üöß In Progress:
- Frontend deployment to Vercel (immediate priority)
- Historical games database implementation

### Repository Structure:
- Main chess app at `/home/caspar/Documents/Coding/Chess/chess-app`
- Separate backend folder at `/home/caspar/Documents/Coding/Chess/chess-backend`
- Documentation in root directory

## üöÄ Immediate Action Items

### 1. Deploy Frontend to Vercel (TODAY!)
**Steps:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com and login with GitHub
2. Click "New Project" ‚Üí Import `chess` repository
3. **IMPORTANT Configuration:**
   - **Root Directory**: `chess-app` (not root!)
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
4. Add ALL environment variables before deploying (see below)

### 2. Required Environment Variables for Vercel
```bash
# Backend URLs (update with your Railway URL)
VITE_API_URL=https://eloquent-solace-production.up.railway.app
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://eloquent-solace-production.up.railway.app

# Firebase Config (get from Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Tasks
Once frontend is live on Vercel:

**A. Update Backend CORS (Critical!)**
1. Go to Railway ‚Üí Backend Service ‚Üí Variables
2. Update:
   ```
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-chess-app.vercel.app
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-chess-app.vercel.app
   ```
3. Railway will auto-redeploy

**B. Update Firebase Authorized Domains**
1. Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Settings
2. Add your Vercel domain to authorized domains

**C. Test Everything**
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Sign in with Google
3. Create a multiplayer game
4. Test with a friend!

## Known Issues & Fixes

### Firebase Client File
- Moved to `client-files/firebase.client.ts` to prevent backend build errors
- Frontend needs this moved back to proper location before frontend deployment

### Database Connection
- Backend expects `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Railway PostgreSQL provides this automatically when services are linked

### Build Warnings
- "punycode module deprecated" - can be ignored, it's from a dependency
- "Lc0 engines not available" - expected in production, AI features limited

## File Locations
- Backend entry: `src/server.ts`
- Socket handler: `src/sockets/gameSocket.ts`
- Database config: `src/config/database.ts`
- Firebase admin: `src/config/firebase.ts`
- Frontend entry: `src/main.tsx`
- Game context: `src/contexts/GameContext.tsx`
- Socket context: `src/contexts/SocketContext.tsx`

## Commands for Testing
```bash
# Test backend health
curl https://[railway-url].railway.app/health

# Run frontend locally (after setting .env)
npm run dev

# Check Railway logs
railway logs
```

## Final Checklist
- [ ] Frontend deployed to Vercel
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel
- [ ] CORS updated in Railway backend
- [ ] Database tables initialized
- [ ] Multiplayer tested end-to-end
- [ ] Share game links with friends!

## üìä Project Roadmap

## üìù Development Notes

### Current Infrastructure:
- **Backend**: Railway (Hobby plan) - https://eloquent-solace-production.up.railway.app
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Railway (90-day trial - expires ~March 2025)
- **Frontend**: Pending Vercel deployment
- **Auth**: Firebase (free tier)
- **Repository**: Public on GitHub

### Important Files:
- Backend entry: `src/server.ts`
- Frontend entry: `src/main.tsx` (Vite)
- Database schema: `database/init.sql`
- Firebase config needs to be moved from `client-files/` back to proper location

### Performance Considerations:
- Stockfish/LC0 engines not available in production (too resource intensive)
- Using simpler AI for production deployment
- WebSocket connections limited by Railway plan
- Database on free tier has connection limits

**Remember**: The app is fully functional! Just needs frontend deployment to share with the world. üöÄ
